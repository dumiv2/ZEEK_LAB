## Introduction


Introduction
This project centers around configuring Zeek as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and developing scripts using the Zeek programming language to enhance its functionality. Zeek, formerly known as Bro, is a powerful network analysis framework that captures network packets and provides a high-level programming language for analyzing them in real-time.

In this project, we'll delve into the setup and configuration of Zeek to function as an effective IDS. Additionally, we'll explore writing scripts in Zeek's scripting language to perform various tasks such as traffic analysis, protocol detection, and threat detection. By leveraging Zeek's capabilities, we aim to enhance network security monitoring and threat detection within our environment.

## Features

Here are the main features of this project:
- Setting up a virtualized environment using VMware Workstation Pro 17.
- Configuring Zeek as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) within the virtualized environment.
- Writing scripts in Zeek's programming language to enhance network monitoring and threat detection capabilities.
